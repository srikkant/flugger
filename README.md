## flugger / a simple terminal tool to trigger hot reload on save 

the flutter run command does not have any `--watch` flag or equivalent functionality to trigger hot reload whenever source file changes.
this tool starts a watcher to watch your source files and send the hot reload signal to the flutter process.
